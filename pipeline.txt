GitLab CI/CD
    -> Automation engine
    -> Enables teams to perform DevOps practices
        . Continuous Integration
        . Continuous Devlivery/Deployment
    -> Automatically build, test, and deploy using a GitLab pipeline

GitLab Pipeline
    -> .gitlab-ci.yml
    -> Automated set sequential steps to build, test, and deliver.deploy your code
    -> GitLab pipeline have two main components
        . Jobs describe the tasks that need to be done
        . Stages define the order in which jobs will be completed
    -> a pipeline basiclly is a set of instructions for a program to execute
    -> The program that execute jobs in a gitlab pipeline is called a gitlab runner

GitLab Runner
    -> Separate program that can be run on your local host, VM or even container
    -> Semilar to jenkins agent
    -> gitlab assigns pipeline jobs to available Runners at pipeline runtime (either by using shared runners or a custom runner)
